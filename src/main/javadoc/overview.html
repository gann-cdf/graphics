<p>A framework for easy access to Java AWT and Swing drawing components</p>

<p>This framework provides a (thin) wrapper for Java AWT and Swing drawing components, to both facilitate their
    initial use and the eventual transition to the "unwrapped" components themselves. The intent of this framework is to
    provide the capability to easily write single class applications that implement drawing routines and animation.</p>

<h1>Sample Program</h1>

<pre>
import org.gannacademy.cdf.graphics.geom.*;
import org.gannacademy.cdf.graphics.ui.*;

import java.awt.Color;

// Build your app as an extension of the AppWindow class (which sets up the window and drawing panel for you)
public class DrawingApp extends AppWindow {

  // Override the setup() method to define your drawing
  &#064;Override
  protected void setup() {
    // draw a blue rectangle with a black outline (the default)
    Rectangle r = new Rectangle(200, 75, 200, 200, getDrawingPanel());
    r.setFillColor(Color.BLUE);

    // draw a red, transparent circle with a black outline
    Ellipse e = new Ellipse(250, 125, 200, 200, getDrawingPanel());
    e.setFillColor(new Color(255, 100, 100, 200));
  }

  // Start your app by instantiating it in your main method
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    new DrawingApp();
  }
}
</pre>
